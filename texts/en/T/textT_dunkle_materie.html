<h2 style="text-align: center;">Dark Matter – The Shadow of Truth</h2>
<img src="/assets/img/dunkle_materie.png" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:12px; margin:1em 0;">

<p>
Dark matter is more than a missing particle – it is the <strong>missing resonance</strong> between what exists and what we’re able to perceive.
</p>

<p>
It follows the same principles as everything else: frequency, amplitude, inertia.<br>
But if its frequency doesn't align with our field, it becomes invisible – like a thought we haven't yet grasped.
</p>

<h3>What if …</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dark matter isn’t absent – just <em>unrecognized</em>?</li>
  <li>It’s an echo of past impulses – stored, but source-less?</li>
  <li>It acts not only physically, but socially – as suppressed truth?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our model suggests:</h3>
<p>
Dark matter is the unused space between idea and realization.  
It emerges through decoherence, loss of information – or deliberate suppression.  
But the moment the field resonates, the shadow turns to light.
</p>

<p><em>Perhaps darkness doesn’t make up 85% of the universe –  
but 85% of our story we couldn’t yet feel.</em></p>
