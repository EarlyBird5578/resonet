<h2 style="text-align: center;">Governments in Frequency Collapse – Why the System No Longer Works</h2>
<img src="/assets/img/t_regierung_realitaet.png" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:12px; margin:1em 0;">

<p>
  Modern governments are no longer in sync with reality.  
  They are built on structures slower than the world they try to control.
</p>

<p>
  Decisions are not born from resonance, but from power dynamics.  
  Truth doesn’t matter – strategy does.  
  Not life, but the preservation of control.
</p>

<h3>Why the current system is failing</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency loss</strong> – Reactions come too late. Measures fizzle or destroy trust.</li>
  <li><strong>Amplitude of manipulation</strong> – Media, language, and fear narratives are used to maintain control instead of fostering understanding.</li>
  <li><strong>Inertia of bureaucracy</strong> – Change is blocked instead of supported. Innovation is seen as a threat, not a chance.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We live in a world full of possibilities – but are ruled as if it’s still 1950.  
  The system protects itself. Not people. Not life. Not the future.
</p>

<h3>Why real change must come from the outside</h3>
<p>
  A system based on fear cannot create trust.  
  A system that doesn’t reflect itself cannot become conscious.
</p>

<p>
  We don’t need more control – we need resonance.  
  Decisions born from connection, not dominance.  
  Responsibility that is shared, not outsourced.
</p>

<h3>What could a government in resonance look like?</h3>
<p>
  Not as a pyramid, but as a living structure.  
  Not as a party system, but as a network.  
  Not as control, but as an amplifier for truth and consciousness.
