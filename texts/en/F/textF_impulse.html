<h2 style="text-align: center;">Impulses – Feel the Frequency</h2>
<p>
  This page will soon be filled with short impulses – thoughts, questions, images, sounds.  
  Small waves of frequency designed to touch, remind, or move you.
</p>

<p>
  Each impulse is a fragment. Some are scientific, others poetic.  
  Some loud, others quiet. But all arise from the same source:  
  <strong>the movement of life itself</strong>.
</p>

<h3>What to expect here</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Visual frequency fields</li>
  <li>Resonance questions for your inner self</li>
  <li>Short experiments with space, time & feeling</li>
  <li>Connections between thought and matter</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each time you open this page, you'll see a different impulse –  
  <em>like a heartbeat that never repeats exactly.</em>
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">
  <em>Until then: Feel your own frequency.</em>
</p>
