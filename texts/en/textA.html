<h3>1. What is Amplitude?</h3>
<p>
  Amplitude describes the displacement of a wave – how strongly a signal affects the field.
  The greater the amplitude, the more noticeable, visible, and intense the frequency becomes. 
  It is the measure of intensity.
</p>

<h3>2. Amplitude Creates Meaning</h3>
<p>
  A weak oscillation often goes unnoticed. Only when a frequency gains enough amplitude can it penetrate fields,
  reach systems, and leave an impact. Amplitude determines whether a pulse is a whisper or a call.
</p>

<h3>3. Amplitude Is Not Just Volume</h3>
<p>
  It can manifest in many forms – as emotion, light intensity, pressure, or repetition.
  It is often felt rather than measured. Some impulses work through presence, not through force.
</p>

<h3>4. Amplification & Dissonance</h3>
<p>
  Amplitude can combine with other fields – or cancel out. Two identical impulses amplify each other,
  two opposite ones neutralize each other. This is called interference.
</p>

<h3>5. Amplitude Is Relationship</h3>
<p>
  Strong amplitude without connection reaches nothing. It needs resonance surfaces. 
  A scream in an empty room fades away – only through feedback does communication emerge.
</p>

<h3>6. Amplitude Needs Direction</h3>
<p>
  Without frequency, there is no amplitude – only energy without form.
  And without inertia, it dissipates. Amplitude arises between beginning and persistence. 
  It is the intensity of the in-between.
</p>

<h3>→ What Follows from Amplitude?</h3>
<p>
  The greater the amplitude, the greater the influence – but also the responsibility.
  What acts strongly can empower or destroy. That’s why conscious amplitude matters:
  not just being loud, but being clear.
