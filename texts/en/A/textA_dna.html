  This page will soon host the interactive ReSonet DNA:
  a living network of connections, fields, and resonance lines.
</p>
<p>
  Every impulse, every statement, and every emotion creates a pattern – 
  a trace in the field that can be visualized. The ReSonet DNA reveals these 
  patterns and their meaning: How strong is something? Where does it expand? 
  What does it resonate with?
</p>
<p>
  Soon you'll be able to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>See random or thematic amplitude impulses</li>
  <li>Discover links to other statements or fields</li>
  <li>Leave your own patterns – if you wish</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This page is constantly evolving – stay tuned.</em></p>
