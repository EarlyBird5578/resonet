<h2 style="text-align: center;">Frequency as the Beginning of Everything</h2>

<h3>1. What is a Frequency?</h3>
<p>
  A frequency is a repeating motion – a pulse, a rhythm, a vibration.
  It describes how fast or slow an event repeats, whether it’s a wave,
  a thought, or a heartbeat. Frequency is movement with rhythm.
</p>

<h3>2. Origin – The First Impulse</h3>
<p>
  Every frequency starts with an impulse – an event that triggers movement.
  The moment before something begins to oscillate is a point: silent, yet full of potential.
  Only with the second beat does rhythm emerge – frequency begins to live.
</p>

<h3>3. Direction and Speed</h3>
<p>
  Frequency has direction – toward something or away from it. It can expand or
  contract. And it has speed: the faster, the higher the frequency; the slower, the deeper.
  We sense this in music, speech, emotions, or light.
</p>

<h3>4. Forms of Frequency</h3>
<p>
  The simplest forms are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Point</strong> – the origin, without oscillation</li>
  <li><strong>Line</strong> – directed impulse, e.g. a laser</li>
  <li><strong>Wave</strong> – cyclic, rhythmic, resonant</li>
</ul>
<p>
  These basic forms appear everywhere – in movement, communication, architecture, and even thoughts.
</p>

<h3>5. Limits of Perception</h3>
<p>
  Our senses only capture a narrow band of the frequency spectrum. What’s too slow seems still – what’s too fast becomes invisible.
  <br>
  A well-known example is the <em>wagon-wheel effect</em>: When something spins faster than our eyes can follow, it may appear still or even rotating backward.
  <br>
  Often, we can only observe the effect in the field – not the object itself. For example, a black hole is definitely there, but it simply oscillates too fast for us to perceive.
</p>

<h3>6. Frequency as the Foundation of Space & Time</h3>
<p>
  Frequency creates time. Without frequency, there would be no repetition – and thus no sense of time.
  <br>
  Frequency also generates space: Depending on how strongly and in which direction it vibrates, expansion occurs. Where frequency ends, space ends.
</p>

<h3>7. What Follows from Frequency?</h3>
<p>
  Frequency is the first step. But only through interaction with other frequencies does amplitude arise.
  And only through resistance does inertia form.
  <br>
  Frequency alone is pure – but not complete. It needs interaction, feedback – resonance.
